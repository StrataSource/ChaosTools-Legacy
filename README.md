# Chaos Tools

This repository contains several GUI tools.

- SDK Launcher - SDK Launcher and workspace profile editor for [Portal 2: Community Edition](https://github.com/ChaosInitiative/Portal-2-Community-Edition)
- CASUI - Config UI Editor for [CAS](https://github.com/ChaosInitiative/CAS)

## SDK Launcher

This is the SDK launcher for chaos engine games such as Portal 2: Community Edition, which serves as a replacement of Valve's old Source SDK launcher tool.

The tool can be used to launch tools like hammer or the game itself and manage chaos source mods.

### Installation

SDKLauncher is shipped with Portal 2: Community Edition on Steam. Since this is a standalone program in its own right, precompiled binaries can be downloaded in the GitHub Releases section

### Currently in-development!

At this time, the program is in a work in progress state and not ready for production use. Use at own risk.

### Technologies used

This program is written in C# using .NET 5.0.

Frameworks:

- [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) (UI-Framework)

- [Facepunch.Steamworks](https://github.com/Facepunch/Facepunch.Steamworks) (Steamworks library)
